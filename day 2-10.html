<h2><em>Introduction</em></h2>
<p>Choose one word to describe the <b>Samsung Galaxy S6</b>. <i>Gorgeous. Powerful. Special. Different</i>. Thank you. That will do. Galaxy S5 has only one of these under its belt and hint... it starts with a P.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S6 is <i>not</i> the next big thing. It's "project zero". The reboot. But was there really anything wrong with the S-line - the standard-setter, the home of the super droids? OK, design needed looking at for sure. But hey, other brands do facelifts - Samsung goes for a complete overhaul.</p>
<p>This must've been the message they wanted to send. <br />
And if it means giving up the memory card slot, the removable battery and the waterproofing, so be it. That's part of the message too.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Galaxy S6 was redone from scratch and bids farewell to plastic. Glass and metal is a critically acclaimed combination. Another way of saying it is - depending on how upset you are with the missing card slot and sealed battery - they're copying Apple and Sony. Alright, memory, battery and waterproofing are easy things to get upset about, so let's see what the Samsung Galaxy S6 offers in exchange.
The new look (13<sup>th</sup> March) is impressive and exciting and Samsung's trademark AMOLED is the perfect match. It's an immersive 5.1 incher of QHD resolution, for the amazing 577<sub>ppi</sub> - though "amazing" doesn't work for Samsung. They'll call it "the best ever" - and will be right. And that's just the beginning.</p>

<p>So, Samsung gave up features that used to give them a competitive edge and decided not to necessarily compete for every spec. Over-confidence or lack thereof? New deal or a knee jerk reaction? There are so many things to discover about the new Galaxy S6 and we are done teasing.</p>
